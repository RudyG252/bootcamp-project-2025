            In this blog post, my plan is to go through each of the racket
            sports I've played chronologically based on when I first tried them,
            and talk a lot about what I think about them and my experiences with
            them. I love rackets so I think this blog will be super fun to write
            and probably also be fairly long.
          </p>
          <h2>The Different Racket Sports I've Tried:</h2>
          <h3>The Beginning (Ping Pong):</h3>
          <img
            src="images/ping-pong.png"
            alt="Two ping pong paddles and a net"
          />

          <p>
            First, of all, I LOVE ping pong, I wish I could play it way more
            than I do currently (I also unfortunately left my paddle at home
            when I went to college). Ping Pong (or table tennis I guess, but I
            think ping pong is more fun) is the first racket/paddle sport I ever
            tried, and it's amazing.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was super little, like 6 or 7, I lived with my grandparents
            and my dad, and they had a ping pong table in their backyard. I was
            really bad obviously, but I would sometimes play with my grandpa or
            my dad, with them obviously going super easy on me, but little kid
            me still had a lot of fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, me and my dad moved out of my grandparents house, and
            after a few years they offered us their ping pong table because they
            weren't using it (my grandpa went blind in one eye and didn't have
            very good depth perception anymore). My dad said yes, and then we
            had a ping pong table in our garage. We used it occassionally, but
            still not super often for a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            When covid started was when I started to get super into ping pong. I
            was stuck in the house and it was an opportunity for me to still get
            energy out, so I would play with my dad whenever I could, and even
            alone I would put on headphones, fold half the table up, and just
            hit the ball again and again for hours while listening to a podcast
            or something.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around that time was when I first started to get good at ping pong.
            I would play against my dad, and he had stopped going easy on me. I
            would play with him every time we had an opportunity, and we would
            usually play a match of a match, which was a best of 3 of best of
            5s, if that makes sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, one year for christmas, my dad got both us actual good
            ping pong paddles, with nice rubber on both sides. After this was
            when I started actually getting good at ping pong, with the
            introduction of spin. The normal crappy paddles we had before didn't
            really have the ability to put spin on the ball, so even though my
            dad knew how (I refused to try), neither of us could use any
            significant spin, but with the new paddle, I was introduced to a
            whole new world of options.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spin allowed me to have so much more fun and options in how to hit
            the ball. I could put way more power into it with topspin, or trick
            my dad with sidespin or backspin, and I had even more fun playing
            against him, as he did the same things against me, and our rallies
            felt way better.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while I became consistently better than my dad, but it was
            still competitive and super fun, however my dad has this friend,
            Steve, who is absurdly good at ping pong. He lives pretty far away
            but whenever he visits or we visit him, I always want to play him,
            and he almost always beats me.
          </p>
          <h4>Ping Pong Conclusion:</h4>
          <p>
            I absolutely love ping pong recreationally, I have amazing memories
            of playing my dad in ping pong and still have a great time playing
            him whenever I feel like it, and it was my first racket sport, but I
            never really played against people better than my dad, and I didn't
            play it as much as other racket sports, so it's not my favorite.
            Ping pong translates pretty well to other racquet sports,
            surprisingly. You use the same spin in tennis so it translates
            decently to that. It also obviously translates really really well to
            pickleball, because it's also a paddle and you're using the same
            spin.
          </p>
          <h3>Racquetball:</h3>
          <img
            src="images/racquetball.png"
            alt="A racquetball racquet and ball"
          />
          <p>
            Racquetball is.... not my favorite racquet sport, so I wont talk
            about it much, however I do credit it with my introduction to my
            favorite racquet sport, which I'll talk about later, so I'll give it
            credit as a very fun recreational racquet sport
          </p>
          <p>
            I first tried racquetball with my mom over the summer between 7th
            and 8th grade, and I thought it was awesome. I had this little fat
            racquet and this ball that would just bounce at full speed
            everywhere, and it was great to have something to do with my mom. It
            truly is an amazing recreational sport, but unfortunately it really
            deteriorates at a high level because of the lack of rules, so I only
            ever played it recreationally for about one summer
          </p>
          <h4>Racquetball Conclusion:</h4>
          <p>
            Racquetball is super fun to play with friends and recreationally,
            but doesn't look very fun at a high level , so I never got super
            into it. The skills for it very poorly transfer with most other
            racquet sports because of the extreme bounciness of the ball and the
            really weird racquet.
          </p>
          <h3>Tennis:</h3>
          <img
            src="images/tennis.jpg"
            alt="An image of two tennis rackets and three tennis balls"
          />
          <p>
            Tennis is not my favorite racket sport, primarily because I really,
            really suck at it. The only time I really played it was with my dad
            when I was at my mom's house during Covid. It allowed us to play
            like we used to play ping pong, but while also practicing social
            distancing across the court, however we both sucked. I've tried it a
            couple times since then, but I was never really able to get into it
            unfortunately.
          </p>
          <h4>Tennis Conclusion:</h4>
          <p>
            I think tennis is an amazing sport at both a recreational and
            especially a high level, it's just unintuitive to me so I've never
            been able to get good at it. I've seen a ton of tennis players in
            other sports, and it translates really well to pickleball and ping
            pong, and gives some boost to beginners in squash and badminton
            because they've handles a racket before, but it creates a lot of bad
            habits that are hard to get rid of.
          </p>
          <h3>Squash:</h3>
          <img
            src="images/Squash.png"
            alt="An image of a squash racquet and ball"
          />
          <p>
            Squash is currently by <strong>far</strong> my favorite racquet
            sport. It is also the only one that I have played competitively in
            any aspect. I was introduced by squash because, well, I thought it
            was racquetball. In the summer between 8th and 9th grade, there were
            a bunch of free summer camps and I signed up for a squash camp that
            I read and thought it was just racquetball with a weird name. It was
            not.
          </p>
          <p>
            I played at that squash camp and had more fun then I had ever had at
            any sport before. You play squash within a confined space, and it is
            very similar in concept to racquetball, except there are rules. You
            can't hit the ball above a certain line, or under a certain line,
            and the ball bounces MUCH less. These things may sound like it makes
            the game less fun, but it allows for so much more creativity and
            strategy, which is what I loved from ping pong, but the walls around
            added another dimension to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I joined the squash club after the camp and started playing several
            times a week and participating in tournamnets. I got my mom and my
            dad to play with me, and they had fun with it as well. Once I got
            good enough to play for real, the sport got even more fun and I
            realized why at a high level it was so much more fun than
            racquetball.
          </p>
          <p>
            I played in a bunch of tournaments and a couple box leagues in the
            time during my freshman and sophomore years of high school, and I
            won one fairly uncompetitive one, but didn't have any good results
            in any hard tournaments, so I wasn't amazing at the sport, but I
            loved playing it and watching it, and I still do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I unfortunately stopped playing after my sophomore year of high
            school because the management of the club I played at became really
            toxic, and it was the only squash club where I'm from (San Diego),
            so there were really no other options, so I stopped playing for two
            years. Now though, there is one squash court at Cal Poly and there's
            also a squash club, so I've been able to start playing again, which
            is amazing.
          </p>
          <h4>Squash Conclusion:</h4>
          <p>
            I am slightly biased, but I think squash is one of if not the best
            racquet sport. It is so fun at every level and so creative in terms
            of the shots you can make and what you can do. It is also
            objectively the most physically demanding, with it's competitors
            being tennis and badminton. Tennis requires long term endnurance and
            cardio, but is nowhere near as physically demanding as squash over a
            short period of time. Badminton requires absurd agility and
            dexterity, but the rallies are simply way shorter. Squash translates
            really well to most other racquet sports in my experience (excluding
            tennis of course). I have some bad habits from squash when playing
            badminton and pickleball, but they're not that hard to get rid of.
          </p>
          <h4>Pickeball:</h4>
          <img
            src="images/pickleball.png"
            alt="A pickeball paddle and ball next to a net"
          />
          <p>
            Pickeball is... okay. It's pretty fun to play recreationally, and
            it's great for older people or people who want a racket sport with
            less movement, but it's kind of boring compared to others.
          </p>
          <h4>Pickleball Conclusion:</h4>
          <p>
            I've played pickleball a couple times when I got invited by friends
            who were really into it. I was pretty good because ping pong
            translates to it really well, and playing with a friend and having
            some friendly competition with other people was really fun, but the
            sport just doesn't have enough movement or creativity in the shots,
            so it gets very stale in my opinion. Pickeball doesn't translate
            really well to anything outside of ping pong and tennis, but most
            other racket sports translate really well to it.
          </p>
          <h2>Badminton:</h2>
          <img
            src="images/badminton.jpg"
            alt="A badminton racket and two birdies"
          />
          <p>
            Badminton is absurdly fun. I very recently started playing, and I am
            <strong>TERRIBLE</strong>, but this is by far my favorite racket
            sport besides squash, and I plan to commit pretty hard to it. I
            recently got my own racket, and joined the badminton club at cal
            poly. Tryouts for a tournament at UCSD are this friday, and I'm
            going to try and probably fail to go to it, but no matter how
            terrible I am right now, I'm having a lot of fun getting better and
            playing with friends.
          </p>
          <h4>Badminton Conclusion:</h4>
          <p>
            Badminton is an awesome sport, it is absurd the amount of agility
            and reflexes the people who are good at this sport have. I want to
            get to that level and play with them. Squash has translated pretty
            well to badminton so far, but I have a problem where I'm not used to
            using my fingers and wrist to control the racket, as it is way
            lighter and smaller than a squash racket. I don't think any other
            racket sports translate well to badminton, maybe tennis a little bit
            but they're very, very different.
          </p>
